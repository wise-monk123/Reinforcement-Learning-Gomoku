## AlphaZero-Gomoku
This is an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm for playing the simple board game Gomoku (also called Gobang or Five in a Row) from pure self-play training. The game Gomoku is much simpler than Go or chess, so that we can focus on the training scheme of AlphaZero and obtain a pretty good AI model on a single PC in a few hours.

### Example Games Between Trained Models
- Each move with 400 MCTS playouts:

### Requirements
To play with the trained AI models, only need:
- Python >= 2.7
- Numpy >= 1.11

To train the AI model from scratch, further need, either:
- Theano >= 0.7 and Lasagne >= 0.1      
or
- PyTorch >= 0.2.0    
or
- TensorFlow


If you would like to train the model using other DL frameworks, you only need to rewrite policy_value_net.py.

### Getting Started
To play with provided models, run the following script from the directory:  
```
python human_play.py  
```
You may modify human_play.py to try different provided models or the pure MCTS.

To train the AI model from scratch, with Theano and Lasagne, directly run:   
```
python train.py
```
With PyTorch or TensorFlow, first modify the file [train.py](https://github.com/wise-monk123/Reinforcement_Learning-/blob/master/train.py), i.e., comment the line
```
from policy_value_net import PolicyValueNet  # Theano and Lasagne
```
and uncomment the line 
```
# from policy_value_net_pytorch import PolicyValueNet  # Pytorch
or
# from policy_value_net_tensorflow import PolicyValueNet # Tensorflow
```
and then execute: ``python train.py``  (To use GPU in PyTorch, set ``use_gpu=True`` and use ``return loss.item(), entropy.item()`` in function train_step in policy_value_net_pytorch.py if your pytorch version is greater than 0.5)

The models (best_policy.model and current_policy.model) will be saved every a few updates (default 50).  


**Tips for training:**
1. It is good to start with a 6 * 6 board and 4 in a row. For this case, we may obtain a reasonably good model within 500~1000 self-play games in about 2 hours.
2. For the case of 8 * 8 board and 5 in a row, it may need 2000~3000 self-play games to get a good model, and it may take about 2 days on a single PC.
